# Student Performance Prediction - End-to-End Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting student performance based on a variety of factors using a student performance dataset. The project is designed using modular programming practices, which improves maintainability, scalability, and reusability. Additionally, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes are integrated using GitHub Actions, and the model is deployed to AWS using Docker.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion and Transformation**: Python scripts in the `src/` folder handle data ingestion and preprocessing.
- **Model Training**: Uses machine learning models like CatBoost for training and evaluation on the student performance dataset.
- **Web Integration**: A web app (`app.py`) that integrates the model with a frontend interface.
- **Docker**: The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated pipeline using GitHub Actions for testing and deployment.
- **AWS Deployment**: Deployment is set up for AWS Elastic Beanstalk, pending account configuration.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker (for local containerization)
- AWS Account (for deployment)
- GitHub Account (for CI/CD)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-performance-ml-project.git
cd student-performance-ml-project
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Python packages using `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, if you are developing or using the project as a package, you can install it using:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (or set the required environment variables manually) to configure any sensitive information (e.g., AWS keys, database credentials, etc.).

Example:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=youraccesskey
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=yoursecretkey
```

### Running the Application Locally

Start the application using:

```bash
python app.py
```

Your application should be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Docker Setup

To build and run the project in a Docker container:

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t student-performance-ml .
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 student-performance-ml
```

Your application should be available at `http://localhost:5000` inside the container.

### GitHub Actions & CI/CD Pipeline

The `.github/workflows/` directory contains the workflow configurations for CI/CD. Upon each push to the repository, GitHub Actions will trigger the pipeline to:

1. Run unit tests and linting.
2. Build and push the Docker image.
3. Deploy the application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

### AWS Deployment

The deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk is set up using `.ebextensions` and a `Dockerfile`. However, to complete the deployment, you'll need to configure your AWS Console Account.

### Log Monitoring

Logs from training and inference are stored in the `logs/` directory. These logs can be reviewed for debugging and monitoring model performance.

### Model Artifacts

Once trained, the models and their associated files are stored in the `artifacts/` folder for reuse. This includes the trained model, hyperparameter configurations, and any performance metrics.

## Modularity and Code Organization

This project follows a modular design for easy maintenance and scalability. The key components are:

- **Data Ingestion and Transformation**: Found in `src/data_processing.py`.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Located in `src/model.py`.
- **Web Integration**: The `app.py` serves the model through a REST API.
- **Logging**: All logs related to model training, predictions, and errors are stored in the `logs/` folder.
- **Artifacts**: Model artifacts (e.g., CatBoost model) are saved in the `artifacts/` directory.

## Usage

### Model Training

To train the model, run the following script:

```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

This will process the data, train the model, and save the trained model to the `artifacts/` folder.

### Making Predictions

To make predictions using the trained model, use the following command:

```bash
python src/predict.py --input data/test_data.csv
```

Replace `data/test_data.csv` with the path to your own input data.
